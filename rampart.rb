  # Quast and quake are now optional on mountain lion but recommended on
  # all other platforms.  For Quast, this is because mountian lion does not
  # seem to have matplotlib installed by default, which is a key dependency.
  # For Quake, it has a dependency on jellyfish2, which doesn't seem to be
  # configured correctly to use the right compiler (C++) at this point in
  # time (4th Dec 2014).  We may remove this check in the future.
